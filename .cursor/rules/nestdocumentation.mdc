# AI Context Rule: NestJS Project Conventions

ðŸ“Œ This project is built using [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

## âœ… General Guidelines
- Follow NestJS conventions for controllers, services, modules, and DTOs.
- Business logic should be handled in services, not in controllers.

## ðŸ¤– Notes for AI Assistant
- Use dependency injection as NestJS does by default.
- Always validate inputs via DTOs and `class-validator`.
- Follow Nest's modular architecture unless specified otherwise.
